# Dropship

A browser-based markdown editor, designed to work offline, and to be able to be saved locally and ran from static files, without a web server.

Currently, this project is a very bare-bones MVP - Allowing for editing markdown (with syntax highlighting) and for viewing the rendered output in-browser.

## Development

To build this from source, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To run static checks on the codebase, run:

```bash
npm test
```
